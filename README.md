Quantum computers upend all traditional notions of the digital (“classical”) computer we use today. This paper firstly explores quantum computing far-reaching impact on modern day distributed systems. Secondly, it paints a future where quantum computers are network connected via the Quantum IP (QIP) Stack which is the modern day equivalent of the TCP/IP stack. Third, it explores Quantum Consensus Algorithms for Leader Election Problem in Distributed Systems
